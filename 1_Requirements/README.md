# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project the user can easily convert any number system such as: Binary to decimal, octal, hexadecimal. Decimal to binary, octal, hexadecimal. Octal to binary, decimal, hexadecimal. Hexadecimal to binary, decimal, octal. 

## Research
![Description](Link to Pic)
We communicate with each other in a particular language made of letters or words. We normally type letters or words through keyboard of the computer, but computer does not understand the words and letters. Rather, those words and letters are translated into numbers. This means that computers understand only numbers. We know the decimal (base 10) system, and are very comfortable with performing operations using this system, it is also important for us to understand that the decimal system is not the only system in the world. By studying other number systems such as binary (base 2), quaternary (base 4), octal (base 8), hexadecimal (base 16) and so forth, we will gain a better understanding of how number systems work in general. Number systems are the technique to represent numbers in the computer system architecture, every value that you are saving or getting into/from computer memory has a defined number system. As Computer architecture supports following number systems so we need to study them and also need to know the conversion technique between them.
